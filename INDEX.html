  <p>Training your chest shouldn't be a futile exercise in monotony.

If you're boring and don't want to experience truly massive gains, feel free to rep through endless
standard bench press sets and pec deck reps until your back fuses with the surface of the platform
 beneath you. You might get better at that one exercise—and there's nothing wanting to post big numbers
  and balloon your bench press max—but you're spurning all of the potential benefits that other moves
  could offer. You want to stimulate your muscles in different ways, so you can challenge them to adapt
   and grow as your training plan progresses. For that, you'll need variety.</p>
